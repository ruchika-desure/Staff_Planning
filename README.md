Used optimization techniques to help an insurance company with finding the optimal number of staff that they need for their insurance application approval process.

## Business Problem Statement:
An insurance company InsurePlus wants help with finding the optimal number of staff that they need for their insurance application approval process for the calendar year 2021. The company operates in three states: A, B and C. The company can either handle an application with the staff that they hire or outsource it to a vendor. There is no capacity limitation to outsourcing.</br>

## Business Objective
The objective is to optimise the total cost for the application approval process by distributing the right number of applications between the FTEs and the vendors while meeting the monthly demand for each state at the same time.
